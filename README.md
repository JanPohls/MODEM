# MODEM
Multi-variable Optimization software driven by Design of Experiments and Machine learning

With this GUI, multiple variables can be optimized to reveal the desired result. The optimization strategy is based on Design of Experiments and Machine Learning. In the first step, a variable space is defined and a set of experiments is proposed using the Latin Square method which will cover the entire variable space. After the experiments were conducted, the results will be uploaded to the machine learning algorithm and the machine learning algorithm can predict the optimum conditions. Furthermore, the classification data can be saved and used as a constraint for the Design of Experiments approach.

**RUN**
Download the three Python files: MachineLearning.py, MachineLearning_DoE.py, and LatinSquare.py and place them in the same folder. For the GUI, run 'python MachineLearning_DoE.py'.

For more instructions about the GUI, please download and read the file: Manual_MODEM.pdf.
